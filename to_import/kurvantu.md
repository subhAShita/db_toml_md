कुर्वन्तु कीर्तन-शतानि रणाङ्गनेषु  
मथ्नन्तु वैरिनिकरं धनम् उत्सृजन्तु ।  
कालान्तरे तद् अखिलं प्रबलान्धकार-  
नृत्योपमं कविजनैर् अनिबध्यमानम् ॥

They may perform hundreds of famous acts, on the battle-fields they may churn the enemy masses, they may donate wealth,  
but with the passage of time all these deeds will be like a dance performed in overpowering darkness;  
unless they are limitlessly praised by the poet-folks.

This is from the Koni (near Khutaghat Dam, Ratanpur, Chhattisgarh) stone inscription from circa 1148-49 CE during the reign of king pR^ithivideva of the ratnapura kalachuri clan. The author kAshala was the quintessence of the erudite kShatriya before the horror years of Indian history. He declares himself as being a warrior, poet, veterinary physician of elephants and philosopher. Ironically nothing is known of him but for this inscription- in a sense he was a poet immortalizing himself.
