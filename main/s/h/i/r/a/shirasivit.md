शिरसि वितीर्णो युवभिर्  
गणपतिर् इह मम पुरा यो ऽभूत् ।
प्रणमामि बत तम् अधुना  
तुष्टा भव हतजरे! कामम् ॥

घन-तरुण-वयसि  
रसाकुलया कयाचित्  
सुरत-समये गणपति-मूर्तिर् उपधानीकृता ।  
यौवनावेग-शान्तौ  
ताम् एव पूजयन्ती  
सा जराम् उपालभते ।

Below is the Skt rendering of the original Prakrit -- the two are v.close. Below the verse is the gloss. While the authors render it with some "poetic" license, i.e., adding context+padding not in the actual verse itself, the core issue that seems to bother some people is made explicit in the gloss. Given the context of the actual verse that's suggestively implied. 

What is interesting to us is the mention of a gaNapati (idol) in text composed by an andhra monarch. The andhra-s were over by 250 CE. Hence, it is a fairly early attestation of an image of the god, whose prominent archaeological attestation comes only later in time.
