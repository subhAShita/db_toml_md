He who engages in the cruel game of destruction at the end of the eon,  
the destroyer of [Dakşa's] ritual,  
with camphor- and jasmine-hued luster,  
who sports on the peak of Kailasa,  
who wearing the crescent moon,  
is the ardent lover sharing shalf of his body with his wife,  
who enjoys playing with skeletons,  
who manifests in the many arts,  
who has the black goddess of time as his wife,  
who has a throat as black as the Kālindī river ,  
verily may that skull-bearer send forth benevolence to us. - MT
