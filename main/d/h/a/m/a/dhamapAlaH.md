There are two types of ghosts namely, the Ghost which guards the wealth and the Ghost which is attached to the wealth. The first ghost will, after guarding the wealth, hand over the same to the owner. But the second ghost which is attached to wealth will not part with that wealth to anyone. (These two ghosts can be compared to two types of people to whom wealth may be given for safe-guarding. The first type will return the wealth. The second type due to deep attachment to the wealth, will not part with the same).
